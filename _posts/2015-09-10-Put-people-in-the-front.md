I’ve been researching a lot about design, processes, methods, approaches, psychology and other stuff that involves it the last month.

###<center>The deeper I got the clear it was that we should design thinking first in people, make a product that fits the needs of its users.</center>

When I graduated from college I thought I had a good understanding of making good products, but as I see today, what I had back then was just knowledge and focus on the product itself, kind of making software for the software sake. 

My university didn’t help me. Distinguishing coding from making a usable/reliable/good product was clear just years after. What was said to be important was make the code to run quickly and accomplish the established goal. And the goal was the real problem.

**The goal sometimes is pretty generic and high level. We need to try to go onto its roots, maybe it's there where we got to focus.**

We need to see through lines of code, find the problem, ask lots of questions, see that if you were asking the wrong questions, define a new problem, come up with some ideas, pick one, refine it, until you are clear of the problem. This is cycle for understanding the needs of the user. 

*Oh, yeah! ... the user.*

Let's agree on something, for basically every system the word "user" is pretty generic, Andrew Mayfield in the talk [Five Short Stories from Five Years Designing for Designers](http://uxweek.com/videos/ux-week-2014-andrew-mayfield-five-short-stories-from-five-years-designing-for-designers) points out we gotta call him for what he really is, a person, if it's a pizza app, it's not a user it's a hungry person as tells us Andrew. 

###<center>People don't buy software just to have it, they want to accomplish something. Software is a mean, not the end.</center>

It's really easy to lose yourself thinking about making a really beautiful and appealing app with the latest tech, great animated transitions, etc. **Deliver a good solution is hard work**. Don't let your sight get too narrow, always think on the people the product is made for, they are the goal, they need to get satisfied.

[Human-Centered Design](http://www.designkit.org/human-centered-design) is a common approach that designers use for problem solving and a great subject to jump right in if you want to be closer to the user. 

Also a good process that you can look up is about the  [full process designer](http://fullprocessdesigner.com) where you can see what is a designer in this full process, you also can find about the full process on this [podcast episode](http://www.travandlos.com/29) (a great podcast btw).

*Let me hear your thoughts on the subject. Please, comment! I'll be happy to discuss and learn about this topic.*
