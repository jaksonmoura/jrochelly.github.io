When we love a field we tend to dig deep in it, learn new stuff related to it and sometimes we narrow our sight and become unaware of the other fields that surround us. This can be related to any field, specially the creative ones.

Getting ourselves around people only from the same field develops a kind of blindness, we tend to share the same values, points of view, ways of thinking. Designers are the ones who must think about how people interact with the world, how they feel when they use a product. So how could we get this information if we just hangout with other designers?

It's important to avoid this from happening. We need to always be curious and try not to judge anything. I'm learning as much as I can in the design field, but I also keep reminding me to learn about completely different things, like psychology or blacksmiths(?). They all keep your mind fresh and make it possible for your to understand the world from a different angle. Also, these angles can help us empathize much easily with the user's problems, making us able to put the user's shoes, as you may already read before.

Maybe you've heard of T-shaped skills, it's a draw form that represents the knowledge of a person. The horizontal line shows the different skills one may have and the vertical line is about the deep knowledge of a specific skill.

I think we have learned something other than about our fields, but not always thinking we could relate that to our jobs. Even though we can't connect the dots like this, by being more aware of the surroundings the new stuff we learn can be stored in our long-term memory and then we can see a link in the future.

Well that was a short thought of mine.
I hope that can be insightful.
