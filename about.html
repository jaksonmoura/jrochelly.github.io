title: About me
---

<p>Hi, my name is Jakson Rochelly, I'm a 23 years old <b>passionate web developer</b> who likes to code using ruby/rails and make cool stuff.</p>

<p>Currently I'm working at <a href="http://saude.to.gov.br">Secretaria de Saude</a> where I develop internal web apps, trying to bring better usability to them.</p>
<p>I'm the kind of guy who likes to discover about the world, specially the tech one. Traveling around the globe is one of my wishes, but for me, what matter most is to be surrounded by good people.</p>
<p>I really enjoy coding. Making programs others can use is a big challenge, but even thus, it's awesome! :D</p>
