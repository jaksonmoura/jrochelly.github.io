title: Rails Forum Relaunched
---

It's great to see again a forum that was huge coming back. This days we have [stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) which is great, but it has a limitation that forums are built for: **discuss**. Discuss is a key for keeping moving forward.

I really enjoy this return. I hope it can turns again into a place for great discussions and friendship.
