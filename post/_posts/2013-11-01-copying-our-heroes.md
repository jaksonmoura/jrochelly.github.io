title: "Copying our heroes: A (slightly) different way of learning"
---

###There's always blog posts, talks, etc, about how to become a great developer/designer showing you tons of lists with sites and books to guide you, which is also really good. I want to show you a different approach for getting good at something.

Recently I read a book by Austin Kleon, **[Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative](http://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1377275103&sr=1-1&keywords=Steal+Like+an+Artist%3A+10+Things+Nobody+Told+You+About+Being+Creative)**, a really nice book with great advices. As the title says, it is about creativity, but a part of the book really touched me, it shows a path for learning.

I believe that what made us who we are today was what we tried to achieve yesterday. We set in our heads a level to reach, and then go after it. Sometimes it is conscious, sometimes it's not. For example, if you want to become a developer, you surround yourself with books, applications, start reading developer stuff, follows some dev guys on the internet. That's what most of us do, but with time we don't follow this spirit anymore. We get stuck.

Instead, we should continue pursuing our dreams, still be curious, stay hungry and foolish as Steve Jobs liked to say.

###Copy your heroes
One of the advices is **"Fake it 'til you make it"**. It's something like I write above, but you are not going to lie, actually, you will inspire yourself. 

>“Start copying what you love. Copy copy copy copy. At the end of the copy you will find your self.” —Yohji Yamamoto

We don't start our lives with all the sense of good and bad, we don't even know who we are. We learn by pretending to be our heroes, we learn by copying.

Use tools they use, read what they read. Then look for doing what they would do instead of what they do today. Emulate them. This is when you are doing your own thing. You break the mirror and go further.

Do this with all of your heroes, mix them, get the better you see from every hero you have, than apply this in your life, internalize.

When you start thinking like your heroes is when you stop faking and start being what once you desire.

###Surround yourself with awesome people
You are only going to be as good as the people that surround you. That is works for offline and online spaces. Follow the best.

>"If you ever find that you’re the most talented person in the room, you need to find another room."

This little advices will keep in my mind and I hope they were good for you as well.

Do a great job! =)
