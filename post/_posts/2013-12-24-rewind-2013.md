title: "Rewind: 2013"
---

This was a year of changes for me. I moved to Palmas - TO to work, the job itself, living only with friends and my girlfriend.

I've encountered rocks on the path, big ones, crazy ones, but in the end they were all good because I've grown up.

It all started in October 2012, with a job exam for civil servant, which turns out me and 3 more friends have passed, but we were just called to work at march 2013, pretty much time, isn't it? Well, This was a life changer.

The whole new life helps to grown up a bit more, get more responsibilities, learn new stuff about life. Also, as I worked, I experienced things that made me think more about the kind of future I want. I'm now sure where I wanna go, I'm gonna do everything to get there. Thus, from this year that's about to start I'm gonna be dedicated to improve myself, learn a lot, start cool projects, to not get stuck without action (zombie mode), investing in new material and tools, just for the sake of a better future.

I already have a basic plan for 2014, one of them started this December, the other ones is upcoming.

2013 was for sure a great year for me and I'm gonna work hard to make 2014 better.

Happy new year!
